# Avenue Code UI Challenge - Inacio Schweller entry #

### Requirements ###
* Node.js;
* Gulp (npm install -g gulp);

### Compile and run ###
* Clone the repository;
* Run ``` npm install ``` and ``` npm install -g gulp ```;
* Then, run ``` gulp ``` to build compile and run the project;

### Unit Testing ###
* I'll not say any excuses at all, I didn't had enough time to complete the challenge with unit testing or/and any other BDD test;
* In any case, I would use Karma (since this is an Angular project) and Jasmine as my test suite.
 
### JS libs ###
* jQuery;
* Angular;
* Mapbox;

### Additional comments ###
* I'm really sorry for not having enough time to complete the full challenge, with the unit testing part. I understand the quality of my application will probably decrease but I'd like to thanks for the opportunity.
